# CHAS-Traffic-Lights
A traffic light graphic in Java for CHAS homework

I have changed the requirements for the program slightly so that the traffic light has 4 states:
1. Red (holds for 10 seconds)
2. Red and Amber (4 seconds)
3. Green (10 seconds)
4. Amber (4 seconds)

## To run the code (Windows):
1. git clone https://github.com/AdaWat/CHAS-Traffic-Lights.git
2. cd CHAS-Traffic-Lights\src\java
3. javac *.java
4. java Main.java
